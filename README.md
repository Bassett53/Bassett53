- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bassett53
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ..RPi4 and NAS.

Retired windows and Linux software app
developer with renewed interests in photography 
and music. Now exploring the world
of openmediavault, music streaming and 
photograhic management on raspberry pi4. 
I might buy a commercial NAS but really they
exceed my data storage requirements. I
come from a world of DOS, CPM and 1gb hard
Drives. I like simplicity, speed and 
minimalism.
